# My Git Learning Notes

## Commands I've Learned :

- `git status` - Shows the current state of my repository
- `git add <file>` - Stages a file for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Creates a commit with a message
**- `git push` - Sends my commits to GitHub
- `git diff` - Shows what changed in my files
## Key Concepts :

- **Staging area**: Where I prepare files before committing
- **Commit**: A snapshot of my work at a specific point in time
- **Commit conventions**: Using prefixes like feat:, fix:, docs: to categorize changes

## What I Accomplished in This Workshop :
- Configured Git with my identity - Created my first commit - Fixed mistakes using proper commit messages - Added documentation - Learned to clean up files properly - Reviewed my commit history ## 

Next Steps :
 - Practice Git daily in my projects - Explore branching and merging - Learn about pull requests - Contribute to open source projects
